        <ul>
          <li>First, we create ads based on our awesome research.</li>
          <li>
            Secondly, we launch these ads based on smart data and insights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thirdly, (based on our findings) we re-work them to make your ads
            better, stronger and get them working even harder for your brand.
          </li>
          <li>
            We keep this process on loop until our ads are bringing in big bucks
            for you!
